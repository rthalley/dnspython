    If a port is not specified, random ports will be chosen.

    Applications should subclass the server and override the handle()
    method to determine how the server responds to queries.  The
    default behavior is to refuse everything.

    If use_thread is set to False in the constructor, then the
    server's main() method can be used directly in a trio nursery,
    allowing the server's cancellation to be managed in the Trio way.
    In this case, no thread creation ever happens even though Server
    is a subclass of thread, because the start() method is never
    called.
