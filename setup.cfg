long_description = dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all
    record types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
    updates.  It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

    dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
    level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
    class, and return an answer set.  The low level classes allow
    direct manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.
