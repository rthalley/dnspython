What's New in dnspython
=======================

2.4.0 (in development)
----------------------

* The stub resolver now uses instances of ``dns.nameserver.Nameserver`` to represent
  remote recursive resolvers, and can communicate using
  DNS over port 53, HTTPS, TLS, and QUIC.  In additional to being able to specify
  an IPv4, IPv6, or HTTPS URL as a nameserver, instances of ``dns.nameserver.Nameserver``
  are now permitted.

2.3.0
-----

* Python 3.7 or newer is required.

* Type annotations are now integrated with the source code and cover
  far more of the library.

* The get_soa() method has been added to dns.zone.Zone.

* The minimum TLS version is now 1.2.

* EDNS padding is now supported.  Messages with EDNS enabled and with a
  non-zero pad option will be automatically padded appropriately when
  converted to wire format.

* ``dns.zone.from_text()`` and ``dns.zone.from_file()`` now have an
  ``allow_directives`` parameter to allow finer control over how directives
  in zonefiles are processed.

* A preliminary implementation of DNS-over-QUIC has been added, and will be
  available if the aioquic library is present.  See ``dns.query.quic()``,
  ``dns.asyncquery.quic()``, and examples/doq.py for more info.  This API
  is subject to change in future releases.  For asynchronous I/O, both
  asyncio and Trio are supported, but Curio is not.

* DNSSEC signing support has been added to the ``dns.dnssec`` module, along with
  a number of functions to help generate DS, CDS, and CDNSKEY RRsets.  Thank you
  very much Jakob Schlyter!

* Curio asynchronous I/O support is deprecated as of this release and will
  be removed in a future release.

* The resolver object's ``nameserver`` field is planned to become a property in
  dnspython 2.4.  Writing to this field other than by direct assignment is deprecated,
  and so is depending on the mutability and form of the iterable returned when it is
  read.

2.2.1
-----

This release has no new features, but fixes the following issues:

* dns.zone.from_text failed if relativize was False and an origin was
  specified in the parameters.

* A number of types permitted an empty "rest of the rdata".

* L32, L64, LP, and NID were missing from dns/rdtypes/ANY/__init__.py

* The type definition for dns.resolver.resolve_address() was incorrect.

* dns/win32util.py erroneously had the executable bit set.

* The type definition for a number of asynchronous query routines was
  missing the default of None for the backend parameter.

* dns/tsigkeyring.py didn't import dns.tsig.

* A number of rdata types that have a "rest of the line" behavior for
  the last field of the rdata erroneously permitted an empty string.

* Timeout intervals are no longer reported with absurd precision in
  exception text.

2.2.0
-----

* SVCB and HTTPS records have been updated to track the evolving draft
  standard.

* The ZONEMD type has been added.

* The resolver now returns a LifetimeTimeout exception which includes
  an error trace like the NoNameservers exception.  This class is a subclass of
  dns.exception.Timeout for backwards compatibility.

* DNS-over-HTTPS will try to use HTTP/2 if the httpx and h2 packages
  are installed.

* DNS-over-HTTPS is now supported for asynchronous queries and resolutions.

* ``dns.zonefile.read_rrsets()`` has been added, which allows rrsets in zonefile
  format, or a restrition of it, to be read.  This function is useful for
  applications that want to read DNS data in text format, but do not want to
  use a Zone.

* On Windows systems, if the WMI module is available, the resolver will retrieve
  the nameserver from WMI instead of trying to figure it out by reading the
  registry.  This may lead to more accurate results in some cases.

* The CERT rdatatype now supports certificate types IPKIX, ISPKI, IPGP,
  ACPKIX, and IACPKIX.

* The CDS rdatatype now allows digest type 0.

* Dnspython zones now enforces that a node is either a CNAME node or
  an "other data" node.  A CNAME node contains only CNAME,
  RRSIG(CNAME), NSEC, RRSIG(NSEC), NSEC3, or RRSIG(NSEC3) rdatasets.
  An "other data" node contains any rdataset other than a CNAME or
  RRSIG(CNAME) rdataset.  The enforcement is "last update wins".  For
  example, if you have a node which contains a CNAME rdataset, and
  then add an MX rdataset to it, then the CNAME rdataset will be deleted.
  Likewise if you have a node containing an MX rdataset and add a
  CNAME rdataset, the MX rdataset will be deleted.

* Extended DNS Errors, as specified in RFC 8914, are now supported.

2.1.0
----------------------

* End-of-line comments are now associated with rdata when read from text.
  For backwards compatibility with prior versions of dnspython, they are
  only emitted in to_text() when requested.

* Synchronous I/O is a bit more efficient, as we now try the I/O and only
  use poll() or select() if the I/O would block.

* The resolver cache classes now offer basic hit and miss statistics, and
  the LRUCache can also provide hits for every cache key.

* The resolver has a canonical_name() method.

* There is now a registration mechanism for EDNS option types.

* The default EDNS payload size has changed from 1280 to 1232.

* The SVCB, HTTPS, and SMIMEA RR types are now supported.

* TSIG has been enhanced with TKEY and GSS-TSIG support.  Thanks to
  Nick Hall for writing this.

* Zones now can be updated via transactions.

* A new zone subclass, dns.versioned.Zone is available which has a
  thread-safe transaction implementation and support for keeping many
  versions of a zone.

* The zone file reading code has been adapted to use transactions, and
  is now a public API.

* Inbound zone transfer support has been rewritten and is available as
  dns.query.inbound_xfr() and dns.asyncquery.inbound_xfr().  It uses
  the transaction mechanism, and fully supports IXFR and AXFR.

2.0.0
-----

* Python 3.6 or newer is required.

* The license is now the ISC license.

* Rdata is now immutable.  Use ``dns.rdata.Rdata.replace()`` to make a new
  Rdata based on an existing one.

* dns.resolver.resolve() has been added, allowing control of whether search
  lists are used.  dns.resolver.query() is retained for
  backwards compatibility, but deprecated.  The default for search list
  behavior can be set at in the resolver object with the
  ``use_search_by_default`` parameter.  The default is False.

* DNS-over-TLS is supported with ``dns.query.tls()``.

* DNS-over-HTTPS is supported with ``dns.query.https()``, and the resolver
  will use DNS-over-HTTPS for a nameserver which is an HTTPS URL.

* Basic query and resolver support for the Trio, Curio, and asyncio
  asynchronous I/O libraries has been added in ``dns.asyncquery`` and
  ``dns.asyncresolver``.  This API should be viewed as experimental as
  asynchronous I/O support in dnspython is still evolving.

* TSIG now defaults to using SHA-256.

* Basic type info has been added to some functions.  Future releases will
  have comprehensive type info.

* from_text() functions now have a ``relativize_to`` parameter.

* python-cryptography is now used for DNSSEC.

* Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are now supported.

* A helper for NSEC3 generating hashes has been added.

* SHA384 DS records are supported.

* Rdatasets and RRsets are much faster.

* dns.resolver.resolve_address() has been added, allowing easy address-to-name
  lookups.

* dns.reversename functions now allow an alternate origin to be specified.

* The ``repr`` form of Rdatasets and RRsets now includes the rdata.

* A number of standard resolv.conf options are now parsed.

* The nameserver and port used to get a response are now part of the resolver's
  ``Answer`` object.

* The NINFO record is supported.

* The ``dns.hash`` module has been removed; just use Python's native
  ``hashlib`` module.

* Rounding is done in the standard python 3 fashion; dnspython 1.x rounded
  in the python 2 style on both python 2 and 3.

* The resolver will now do negative caching if a cache has been configured.

* TSIG and OPT now have rdata types.

* The class for query messages is now QueryMessage.  Class Message is now a
  base class, and is also used for messages for which we don't have a better
  class.  Update messages are now class UpdateMessage, though class Update
  is retained for compatibility.

* Support for Windows 95, 98, and ME has been removed.
