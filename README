INTRODUCTION

dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
updates.  It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.

dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set.  The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.

To see a few of the ways dnspython can be used, look in the examples/
directory.

dnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate
the testing of DNS software.  Nominum has generously allowed it to be
open sourced under a BSD-style license, and helps support its future
development by continuing to employ the author :).


ABOUT THIS RELEASE

This is dnspython 1.5.0.

New since 1.4.0:

    	Answer objects now support more of the python sequence
	protocol, forwarding the requests to the answer rrset.
	E.g. "for a in answer" is equivalent to "for a in
	answer.rrset", "answer[i]" is equivalent to "answer.rrset[i]",
	and "answer[i:j]" is equivalent to "answer.rrset[i:j]".

	Making requests using EDNS, including indicating DNSSEC awareness,
	is now easier.  For example, you can now say:

	   q = dns.message.make_query('www.dnspython.org', 'MX',
				      want_dnssec=True)

	dns.query.xfr() can now be used for IXFR.

	Support has been added for the DHCID, IPSECKEY, and SPF RR types.

	UDP messages from unexpected sources can now be ignored by
	setting ignore_unexpected to True when calling dns.query.udp.

Bugs fixed since 1.4.0:

        If /etc/resolv.conf didn't exist, we raised an exception
	instead of simply using the default resolver configuration.

	In dns.resolver.Resolver._config_win32_fromkey(), we were
	passing the wrong variable to self._config_win32_search().

New since 1.3.5:

        You can now convert E.164 numbers to/from their ENUM name
        forms:

	      >>> import dns.e164
	      >>> n = dns.e164.from_e164("+1 555 1212")
	      >>> n
	      <DNS name 2.1.2.1.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa.>
	      >>> dns.e164.to_e164(n)
	      '+15551212'

	You can now convert IPv4 and IPv6 address to/from their
	corresponding DNS reverse map names:

	      >>> import dns.reversename
	      >>> n = dns.reversename.from_address("127.0.0.1")
	      >>> n
	      <DNS name 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.>
	      >>> dns.reversename.to_address(n)
	      '127.0.0.1'

	You can now convert between Unicode strings and their IDN ACE
	form:

	      >>> n = dns.name.from_text(u'les-\u00e9l\u00e8ves.example.')
	      >>> n
	      <DNS name xn--les-lves-50ai.example.>
	      >>> n.to_unicode()
	      u'les-\xe9l\xe8ves.example.'

	The origin parameter to dns.zone.from_text() and dns.zone.to_text()
	is now optional.  If not specified, the origin will be taken from
	the first $ORIGIN statement in the master file.

	Sanity checking of a zone can be disabled; this is useful when
	working with files which are zone fragments.

Bugs fixed since 1.3.5:

     	The correct delimiter was not used when retrieving the
	list of nameservers from the registry in certain versions of
	windows.

        The floating-point version of latitude and longitude in LOC RRs
	(float_latitude and float_longitude) had incorrect signs for
	south latitudes and west longitudes.

	BIND 8 TTL syntax is now accepted in all TTL-like places (i.e.
	SOA fields refresh, retry, expire, and minimum; SIG/RRSIG
	field original_ttl).

	TTLs are now bounds checked when their text form is parsed,
	and their values must be in the closed interval [0, 2^31 - 1].

New since 1.3.4:

     	In the resolver, if time goes backward a little bit, ignore
    	it.

	zone_for_name() has been added to the resolver module.  It
	returns the zone which is authoritative for the specified
	name, which is handy for dynamic update.  E.g.

	      import dns.resolver
	      print dns.resolver.zone_for_name('www.dnspython.org')

	will output "dnspython.org." and

	      print dns.resolver.zone_for_name('a.b.c.d.e.f.example.')

	will output ".".

	The default resolver can be fetched with the
	get_default_resolver() method.

    	You can now get the parent (immediate superdomain) of a name
	by using the parent() method.

	Zone.iterate_rdatasets() and Zone.iterate_rdatas() now have
	a default rdtype of dns.rdatatype.ANY like the documentation
	says.

	A Dynamic DNS example, ddns.py, has been added.

New since 1.3.3:

	The source address and port may now be specified when calling
	dns.query.{udp,tcp,xfr}.
	
	The resolver now does exponential backoff each time it runs
	through all of the nameservers.

	Rcodes which indicate a nameserver is likely to be a
	"permanent failure" for a query cause the nameserver to be removed
	from the mix for that query.

New since 1.3.2:

    	dns.message.Message.find_rrset() now uses an index, vastly
	improving the from_wire() performance of large messages such
	as zone transfers.

	Added dns.message.make_response(), which creates a skeletal
	response for the specified query.

	Added opcode() and set_opcode() convenience methods to the
	dns.message.Message class.  Added the request_payload
	attribute to the Message class.

        The 'file' parameter of dns.name.Name.to_wire() is now
	optional; if omitted, the wire form will be returned as the
	value of the function.

	dns.zone.from_xfr() in relativization mode incorrectly set
	zone.origin to the empty name.

	The masterfile parser incorrectly rejected TXT records where a
	value was not quoted.

New since 1.3.1:

	The NSEC format doesn't allow specifying types by number, so
	we shouldn't either.  (Using the unknown type format is still
	OK though.)

	The resolver wasn't catching dns.exception.Timeout, so a timeout
	erroneously caused the whole resolution to fail instead of just
	going on to the next server.

	The renderer module didn't import random, causing an exception
	to be raised if a query id wasn't provided when a Renderer was
	created.

        The conversion of LOC milliseconds values from text to binary was
	incorrect if the length of the milliseconds string was not 3.

New since 1.3.0:

	Added support for the SSHFP type.

New since 1.2.0:

	Added support for new DNSSEC types RRSIG, NSEC, and DNSKEY.

This release fixes all known bugs.

See the ChangeLog file for more detailed information on changes since
the prior release.
